# JavaScript-HighOrderFunctions-Timers-Closures

## Learning Competencies

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Define what a higher order function and callback is
- Understand why higher order functions can help reduce code duplication
- Use setTimeout and setInterval for timing future code execution
- Compare and contrast synchronous vs. asynchronous code
- Understand how the event loop works
- Explain what a closure is and use it to create "private" variables
- Create a module using the module pattern
- Understand what the keyword `arguments` represents and how it can be used

## Overview

#### Overview of High Order Functions
In mathematics and computer science, a higher-order function (also functional, functional form or functor) is a function that does at least one of the following:
Takes one or more functions as arguments,and Returns a function as its result.

- Where do you think we use High Order Functions
- Why do we use them?
 
After your research,move ahead to core Blocks

#### Overview of Timers

It's quite common to write code that we want to be executed after a specific amount of time. Maybe you want to put a timer in a game, or perform some animation on the page after a fixed amount of time has elapsed

- Why do we use timers.
- Think of some examples where timers can be used

Once you are satisfied with your research, move to Core Blocks

#### Overview of Closures

In programming languages, closures are techniques for implementing lexically scoped name binding in languages with first-class functions. Operationally, a closure is a record storing a function together with an environment
- Closures touch upon a gray area where functions and variable scope intersect
- What do you understand by the above statement
- We frequently use closures in JavaScript.Why?

As always, move on to the Core Blocks once you've researched on these
