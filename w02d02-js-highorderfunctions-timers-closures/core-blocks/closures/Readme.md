## Core Blocks

In this challenge,You will be learning about Closures

## Release 0:

Prove the following property using an example
- Inner function able to remember a parameter defined in the outer function which already returned(Closure property)

## Release 1:

Answer the following questions:

- What is a closure?
- List two reasons why closures are useful
- What is a module?
- What is the arguments array-like object?
- Why do we call arguments an array-like-object?

## Release 2:

Whatâ€™s the result of executing this code and why.
  ```
  function test() {
     console.log(a);
     console.log(foo());
     
     var a = 1;
     function foo() {
        return 2;
     }
  }
  
  test();
  ```
## Release 3:

What is result?
  ```
  var a = 1; 
  
  function someFunction(number) {
    function otherFunction(input) {
      return a;
    }
    
    a = 5;
    
    return otherFunction;
  }
  
  var firstResult = someFunction(9);
  var result = firstResult(2);
  ```

  Exercise - Closure and the Sandwich Calculator
Mrs Potts the school dinner lady is tired of all the global sandwich variables getting under her feet and tripping her up all the time. She needs help cleaning her kitchen. Will you help her?

She would like it very much if you would build a sandwich machine for her, but wrap it in a closure so as to keep everything neat.

1. Create a self executing function
like this:

(function() {
})();
This will be our closure and will hold the sandwich machine, keeping all it's parts nicely together.

2. Create methods
Within the closure, create three little functions to add the bread, spread the soya margarine and add the jam. These little methods should use console.log to write a string representing their action to the DOM, e.g. "Now spreading the jam!"

Assign these functions to private variables, we don't want any of the children breaking in to the closure and spreading jam all over the place.

Now, also within the closure create a makeSandwich function which calls the three other methods in sequence, writing the sandwich instructions to the DOM.

3. Smuggle makeSandwich out of the closure
We want Mrs Potts to be able to call makeSandwich, so we need to make a global variable which she can access from the kitchen, the news agent, a flight to Barbados, anywhere.

Assign makeSandwich to the global window object, thus smuggling it out of the closure. Refer back to the example if you need to remember how to do this.

4. Call makeSandwich from outside the closure
You can now call makeSandwich from outside the closure. Because you've used onDomReady, you'll need to call it onDomReady.

## Release 5
Exercise Extension
If you'd like to take this a little further, you could make it receive an array of fillings, then output them in the sandwich.
